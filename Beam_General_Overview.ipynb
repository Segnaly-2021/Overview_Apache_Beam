    "Apache Beam is a multi-language framework (Python, Java, Go, ...) that helps you build and test your pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **PCollection:** A PCollection represents basically the input and the output for each step in your pipeline. As Beam supports both batch and streaming, the data set can be bounded, meaning it comes from a fixed source like a file, or unbounded, meaning it comes from a continuously updating source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PTransform:** A PTransform represents a data processing operation, or a step, in your pipeline. Every PTransform takes one or more PCollection objects as input, performs a processing function that you provide on the elements of that PCollection, and produces zero or more output PCollection objects."
